	<h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am currenlty pursuing an MEng in Computer Science at Cornell Tech with a WiTNY fellowship for women in technology. I received my BS in Multimedia Computing with a minor in Music Technology from Macauly Honors at Brooklyn College. My prior experiences include:</p>
	    <ul>
		<li>Summer research on older adults with mobility difficulties - Cornell Tech </li>
	        <li>Web developer - NYC Human Resources Administration</li> 
		<li>Macaulay Partners Mentor - Macaulay Honors @ Brooklyn College</li>
		<li>Study abroad, digital photography - Florence, Italy
		<li>Note-taker for students with disabilities - Brooklyn College</li>
		<li>Content Editor - Stuck in the Library (literary magazine)</li>
		<li>Music Marketing - Skyelab Music Group</li>
	    </ul>
	<p>Programming allows me the opportunity to combine my passions for creativity and logical problem solving in ways that bring my ideas to life and benefit others. For fun I like to make music and other artworks. I also love to eat chocolate, travel and find cool ice cream spots in NYC. </p>
